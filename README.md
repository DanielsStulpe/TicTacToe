# TicTacToe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the TicTacToe game in Java. The game allows you to play against the computer.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe.git

2. Compile the Java file:

   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java

4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java TicTacToe

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves. For player 'X', enter your move (1-9), and for player 'O', the computer will make a random move.

## Game Board

The game board is displayed in the console as follows:

**7 | 8 | 9**  
**--------**  
**4 | 5 | 6**  
**--------**  
**1 | 2 | 3**

 Each number corresponds to a position on the board where you can make your move.


## Rules
- The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full.
- The player 'X' wins by having three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The player 'O' (computer) wins similarly.
- If the board is full and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
